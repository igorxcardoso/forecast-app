# Weather Forecast Rails/React App

## Overview

This project is a Ruby on Rails application with a React frontend that allows users to fetch weather forecasts based on an address or ZIP code. The app retrieves data from the Meteoblue API and caches results for 30 minutes using Rails' `memory_store`. Cached results include an indicator to show whether the data was retrieved from cache.
